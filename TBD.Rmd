First unzip the data set.
```{r}
unzip ("activity.zip")
```

Then read the activity csv file into R.
```{r}
act <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Time do some clean up. The 'date' field has been loaded as a char. Let's convert it to a date.
```{r}

act[,"date"] <- as.Date(act$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```
